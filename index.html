        <p>I tend to overdo things. A thrilling and very relevant example is this very account, posting my notes, as it
            was. This account was quite literally designed to be the direct antithesis to my normal “spend a month
            making a single animation because it needs to be crisp” attitude. And yet, even despite this, not even a
            month in and I was already pressuring myself to write these long, massive brain essays. Alas, I was
            overdoing it. After a while, the very activity I had designed to be a wind-down became a tedious task I had
            to do. It sounded like work and, naturally, it floated down into the abyss of my tasks.

            Sometimes, overdoing it literally isn’t worth it.</p>
